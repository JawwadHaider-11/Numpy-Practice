# Numpy-Practice
This notebook is an introduction to numpy array.
i have covered basic numpy operations for 1D and 2D numpy arrays.

First of all we have to import numpy as np (it is a convention to import numpy as np you can import it as you want to there isn't a binding).
Note: If you are getting an error importing numpy you better have to install it first which can be done simply done using pythons' package manager.

Later in the notebook we are practicing how we can create a numpy array using random() also how can we create anumpy array using np.arange() function

after it we are practicing numpy indexing and slicing a numpy array.

then we move onto 2D numpy array or we can say a matrix. here we practiced 2D array slicing and indexing also some boolean operation on it.

after that we are moving toward numpy operations section where we are practicing some of the operations that we can perform on a numpy array.

and at last we will practice some universal array function that we can perform on a numpy array there are alot we can perform on an array, some of which we have practiced in our notebook are np.sin(), np.sqrt(), np.max(), np.min(), np.log(), np.exp(), np.std() etc ....
